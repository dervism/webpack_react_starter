# Webpack React Starter
An extremely lightweight starter project. The app contains only one page with the "Hello, world" text.

I made my own starter project as I did'nt find any which are simple. Many of the existing ones either contains to much or they use Webpack in a too complex manner that makes learning difficult.

What I put together:

- Webpack
- Babel 5.4
- React
- SASS
- ESLint
